This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Founder's Map

The goal of this project is to receive data in CSV format with information about Founders of great companies, in order to show it in a table with a map with pins pointing to their quarters.

The CSV data needs to contain some sort of location info (whether lat/lng or address), so it can correctly pin the markers on the map.

The user is able to indicate which columns represent the latitude/longitude info, the address data, and a column to represent the data displayed in the marker pin.

The application shows a table with the content added with the ability to sort/filter and show/hide the company in the map.
